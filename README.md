# RETS client for NodeJS

Inspired by [aeq/rets-client](https://github.com/aeq/rets-client) and [martianboy/rets-client](https://github.com/martianboy/rets-client).

Spec is based on <https://www.nar.realtor/retsorg.nsf/retsproto1.7d6.pdf> and <https://www.reso.org/rets-specifications/>.

## Testing

Tests use [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/).

The tests are located in the `test` folder. They can be run with `npm run test`.
